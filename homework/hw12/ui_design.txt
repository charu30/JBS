Windows

3 features that makes Windows easy to use:

* One can easily learn how to use Windows. It's less complex.
  If a non-technical person wants to send email, he/she can just click on firefox/IE symbol 
  at the bottom and can use the internet.
  
* For a naive user, it will be easy to write a document on Word or Notepad as it is user-friendly and simple to use. 
  (However, for experienced users, they'll be needing more functionality and shortcut. 
 
* On clicking, 'start' button shows all the important folders, recent applications, Recent Items which makes easy to find documents.


3 features that makes Windows diificult to use:

* To activate automatic completion for the current command session

  While working in command prompt, I always face a problem in auto-completion, so have to manually write full path. 
  I find how to activate auto-completion. It's a tedious task. Type cmd /f, then type CTRL+D to complete a folder name or 
  CTRL+F to complete a file name. 
  I wish like Linux, we can just use a tab to auto-complete file name in Windows. 
  
  
* Mostly every application has to be downloaded and installed manually on Windows. I used Ubuntu for some time, and it's so convenient
  to install packages using 'apt-get' command. That feature in windows would have made life so easy.

* For frequent and experienced users, there is no free text editor for Windows like textmate for Mac, with a large number of shortcuts 
  functionalities.
  
  
I have been using Windows since I remeber using computers!. So, I am pretty comfortable with it. However, I want to try and learn Mac
whenever I'll be done learning other things.
